# d3-mindmap

An experiment in building a reuseable mindmap using [d3.js](https://d3js.org/). The code base is forked from the works by [Jeremy Darling](http://bl.ocks.org/jdarling/2073ba4c2d640236e2e2#index.html) and modified to enable more interativities:

- Collapsible node (with proper animation)
- TODO:
    - Zoom
    - Collapsible options
